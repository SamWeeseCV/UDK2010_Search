/**
  Returns the value of the highest bit set in a 64-bit value. Equivalent to
  1 << HighBitSet64(x).

  This function computes the value of the highest bit set in the 64-bit value
  specified by Operand. If Operand is zero, then zero is returned.

  @param  Operand The 64-bit operand to evaluate.

  @return 1 << HighBitSet64(Operand)
  @retval 0 Operand is zero.
